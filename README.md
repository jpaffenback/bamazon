# Bamazon

##Description

This app uses the inquirer and mysql npm packages to create a command line store front linked to a backend database (MySQL).

##Using

When first loaded, the user will see all items currently available in the store. They should see 
an item id, the product name and price. The user will be asked to provide the id that corresponds
 with the item they would like to purchase. Once they make their selection they will get another question asking how much they want to buy.

 After the purchase is made, the total price will be reflected as well as the change being reflected in the database.
